# Angry Birds Procedural Generation

Procedural level generator for Science Birds, clone of Angry Birds.

The code is a modified version of the generator created by Matthew Stephenson for the third AIBIRDS Level Generation Competition held at CIG 2018 in Maastricht. Science Birds was developped by Lucas Ferreira; the Windows version is included in this repository for convenience.

Our focus with this generator was to create varied and irregular structures. Pig placement is the same as in the original baseline generator (and is, admittedly, unadapted to the new structures). TNT was deactivated as it caused instability.

To generate levels, simply execute the Python script. The levels are directly added to Science Birds' data so you can then launch the game to check them out (the generated levels are the ones starting from level 4).

This project was made as part of a university assignment so unfortunately the report as well as the comments in the code are all in French. Sorry!
